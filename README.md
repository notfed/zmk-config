# How to flash

This is the configuration for a BT60 wireless mechanical keyboard. To flash it, do the following:

1. Visit [the Actions screen](../../actions?query=branch%3Abt60-custom) screen of this repository (and filter for this branch).
2. Download the latest build's `firmware.zip` file, and extract the `[whatever].uf2` file from it
3. Plug the keyboard into your computer, and put it in boot mode (e.g., double-tap the reset button). It should mount as a USB storage device on your computer.
4. Drag `[whatever].uf2` into the root folder of the new mounted drive.

To update the key mappings, update the `config/bt60.keymap` file in *this* branch (after reading [the ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs)). A new build should appear in [the Actions screen](../../actions?query=branch%3Abt60-custom).

(The rest of this README came from [PolarityWorks/zmk-config-ckp](https://github.com/PolarityWorks/zmk-config-ckp).)

# Where this came from

This is a clone of the [PolarityWorks/zmk-config-ckp (branch bt60-ANSI)](https://github.com/PolarityWorks/zmk-config-ckp/tree/bt60-ANSI) repository which contains the source code for the BT60 keyboard's ZMK firmware. The key mappings are customized to a custom layout.
